Project Description
Project Name: Pong Game
Pong Game is a classic two-dimensional table tennis-inspired game developed using Java
and JavaFX. The application features two paddles and a ball. The objective of the game is to
use the paddle to hit the ball into the opponent's goal. The player who scores 12 points first
wins the game(It's optional, I choose this score).
The game supports both two-player mode and single-player mode with three levels of AI
difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Players can choose between game modes in a functional
main menu.
Key Features of the Project
● Basic Functionality:
The core gameplay is fully implemented and runs smoothly. The ball bounces off the
paddles, speeds up on each collision, and scoring is handled accurately.
● File Processing:
The game keeps the current score in memory while the match is running. Once the
game ends or is paused, the score tracking pauses/stops accordingly. However, no
long-term file save/load system is implemented as it was not needed for this game
type.
● Authentication:
Not implemented, as the game does not require user registration or login.But If you
choose 'Single Player', game reaction is changing for your option.
● Extra Features:
○ Real-time score tracking
○ Main menu with mode selection
○ 3 levels of AI-controlled opponent
○ Sound effects for game start, scoring, and winning
○ Smooth paddle control and collision mechanics(keyboard's system)
○ Ball acceleration on each paddle hit
