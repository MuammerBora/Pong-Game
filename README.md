# 🕹️ Pong Game

## 🎮 Project Description

**Pong Game** is a classic two-dimensional, table tennis-inspired game developed using **Java** and **JavaFX**. The application features two paddles and a ball. The objective is to hit the ball past the opponent’s paddle into their goal. The player who scores **12 points first** wins the match *(this score limit is optional and was chosen by the developer).*

The game supports both:
- **Two-player mode**
- **Single-player mode** with three levels of AI difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**

Players can choose their preferred mode via a **functional main menu**.
